                    <h3>Show Confidence</h3>
                    <p>Attackers look for ladies who are visible. Scared, perplexed, or preoccupied Women who walk with their heads bowed and their shoulders one with their hands in their pockets, or perhaps one who is weighed down by packages or preoccupied with children. That’s why during situation we should be always confident so that we will not be an easy victim.</p>

                    <h3>Be Aware of your Environment</h3>
                <p>You can be aware of what is going on around you by standing up straight, with your shoulders back, and your head held high. You can choose to escape a threat if you see it coming, or you can be ready to protect yourself. Keep to well-lit places, avoid becoming sidetracked by Instagram, and search for exits or alternate routes.</p>

                    <h3>Learn Safe Boundaries</h3>
                <p>Don't hesitate to take action if a prospective assailant enters your personal space. Setting safe limits is crucial, as is recognizing when someone is making you feel uneasy.</p>

                    <h3>Hammer Strike</h3>
                    <p>One of the simplest methods to protect yourself is by using your car keys. Avoid using your fingernails because doing so puts your hands at greater risk of injury. Instead, if you feel insecure when out at night, hold your keys in your fist so they can be used as a hammer. With the keys protruding from the side of your hand, grasp your key ring in a tight fist similar to how you would a hammer.</p>

                    <h3>Groin Kicks</h3>
                <p>A groin kick may be powerful enough to knock down an assailant who is coming at you from the front, allowing you to flee. As much as you can, maintain your balance. Drive your knee up by raising your dominant leg off the ground. Lean back slightly, extend your dominant leg, and kick powerfully, making contact with the attacker's groin with your lower shin or foot's ball.</p>

                <h3>Palm-Heel Strike</h3>
                <p>This is a desperate attempt to open doors for escape. When the attacker's face isn't blocked or covered, it works best. With your feet in the same position, send a palm strike with your right hand (be sure to rotate right hip), then try a left-right combination.</p>

                    <h3>Elbow strike</h3>
                    <p>Use your elbows if your assailant is nearby and you are unable to gather enough momentum to deliver a powerful punch or kick. To ensure a hard blow, if at all possible, steady yourself with a firm core and legs. Your attacker's neck, jawline, chin, or temple can be struck with your elbow by bending your arm at the elbow and shifting your weight forward. These are all viable targets. This can make your assailant relax their hold, allowing you to flee.</p>

                    <h3>Escape with Hands Trapped</h3>
                <p>Here's what to do if your assailant grabs your arms from behind (it will feel like a bear hug, but you won't be able to move as freely Stopping your attacker's arms from advancing farther into a headlock should be your initial response. Your hips should move to one side. This creates a chance for open-handed slaps to the groin. As you turn into the wrap, elevate the opposing elbow and bring your hand back up to your arms. As you turn in, keep your arms close to your chest. Up until you can withdraw, stay aggressive with your knees and other counterattacks.</p>
